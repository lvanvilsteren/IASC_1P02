			<h2>About my Trip</h2>
				<p>My CWY trip was a bit different then everyone else’s.
				The standard trip is 6 months, 3 months in a Canadian province,
				then 3 months in an aboard country. During each time period, you lived with a counterpart,
				which is a group of two or three, containing one member from Canada, and one member
				from the aboard country. The trip I a had signed up for was 3 months in
				Prince Edward Island (PEI), and then 3 months in Ghana. However, that was not the case.
				Yes, I did go to PEI for 3 months, and I had a blast! However, when it came time to
				go to Ghana, our group (the Canadians) unfortunately were unable to go due to the
				Ebola scare during the time. CWY then planned a trip to Peru for
				the Canadians which would last 2 months, instead of the three.
				We all got to go home from Christmas and then we met
				back up again in January to start our new Adventure.
