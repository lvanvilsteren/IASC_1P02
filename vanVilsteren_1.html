		<h3>
			 <strong> FUN FACTS </strong>
			</h3>
					<ul>
						<li> Newborn piglets learn to run to their mothers’ voices, and can recognize their own names by the time they’re 2 weeks old. Sows have even been known to sing to their young whilst nursing! </li>
						<li> Pigs have hardly any sweat glands, and one of the best ways for them to cool down is to wallow in all of that glorious mud </li>
						<li> A pig's squeal can be as loud as 115 decibels – that’s 3 decibels higher than the sound of a supersonic airliner. </li>
						<li> They may be indiscriminate eaters, but pigs are also highly intelligent and incredibly social animals. When kept in a group they will snuggle close to one another, and prefer to sleep nose-to-nose. Studies have also shown that, much like humans, they dream</li>
					</ul>
